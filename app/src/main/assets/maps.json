Items and power-ups, including one legendary item &ndash; will make as you&rsquo;re like a god!</p> <p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Starting the Game</span><br />The game requires a minimum of 2 players to play and start. Simply press the button ahead of you, if the necessary players are joined in!</p> <p>A random seeker will be chosen.<br />The game will initiate, game starts within 15 seconds, releasing all hiders.<br />Some powerups may be available, and some should not.<br />Once all hiders released, they&rsquo;ve be given atleast 30 seconds of time to hide<br />Hiders can use power-ups to decrease the time.<br />Seekers can use their power-ups to easily find hiders lurking somewhere.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #008000;\">Power-Ups &amp; Game Changer</span><br /><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">For Hiders</span><br />There are 4 total items (including power-ups) for hiders. These are the following:</p> <p>Hint item: Launch Fireworks &ndash; Will summon fireworks wherever you want nearby. Also reduces the seek time by 5 seconds <br />Hint item: Summon Lightning Bolt &ndash; Summons the lightning bolt directly above the hider&rsquo;s head! Since it will lead the seeker into high probability of finding you easily, summoning lightning bolts can reduce the seek time by 10 seconds<br />Emergency Escape Pad &ndash; Summons a pad where a hider can use to escape from the deadly seeker! Run for your lives! As it only usable ONCE! <br />Legendary Item: Book of Hiding (passive) &ndash; Not all hiders can posses the power right away. You have to do something first before obtaining the item. It is a passive item, you&rsquo;ll know what it does if by any chance you&rsquo;ve obtained it.</p> <p>Cooldown: all hider&rsquo;s share the same cooldown, power-ups and items; with this, if one uses an item or power-up, everyone has to wait before using power-ups again &ndash; to avoid abusing seek time from running out so fast.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #800080;\">For Seekers</span><br />Seeker&rsquo;s have only two items (including power-ups). These are as follows:</p> <p>Epic: Movement eye Tracker (EMeyeT) &ndash; With the work of epicness, this can detect nearby hiders within 8 blocks of range within it! Once detected, it will notify all seeker&rsquo;s of who has been detected nearby. Although, it may be epic, its not legendary enough that it can be hacked easily &ndash; any hiders can stand on it and hack as they want, it may take a few seconds, but will buy hiders some time to work with. Every successful hack, will take some time for the EMeyeT to rebuild. Seeker&rsquo;s can also modify the EMeyeT by standing on it as well, returning the EMeyeT to their inventory without hesitation! Only one EMeyeT can be summoned at a time.<br />Seeker&rsquo;s Instinct (passive) &ndash; Everytime a hider uses a hint item, seeker&rsquo;s can identify where is it, if near.<br /> Repair Time: Like hiders, seekers also share the amount of time when reparing EMeyeT! Since they share, they also share information of what EMeyeT holds.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">More Features!</span><br />Pause menu will show information of who&rsquo;s the hider, and who&rsquo;s the seeker(s)!<br />Big map for big game, better hiding, intense seeking!<br />Awesome UI<br />And more!</p>",

There are no checkpoints and underneath you there is a consistent flow of hot burning lava. Traps and hostile mobs are common and you can’t do much to avoid either other than continuously dying and by each try slowly learning the dangers of the map. Find the items in the chest and think of a way out of your prison cell. Hint: lever! Find the access point for the elytra course, jump off the ledge and press the jump button once again to activate the gliding feature for your elytra wings.

This map is recommended for at least two players but preferably more. There are two different teams (zombies vs humans). Make sure that there is an equal amount of players on each team. Before starting make sure that every player enters the graveyard and sets his spawnpoint by typing /spawnpoint in the text chat.",

If you can't code, then the next best thing would be to use Redstone. Remember, this game doesn't actually need commands to work. The game revolves around the beds, and as long as the player sets their spawn point there, all you need to do is give everyone a chest, and scatter materials around the map. It's that easy!</p> <p>An example of this would be to give everyone a wooden pickaxe and leather armor. They can break the blocks on their island to build out and mine the ores to craft stronger armor, while also protecting their spawn point. If their bed gets destroyed, they'll have to return to spawn. When the game is over, just re-download the world and play again!</p>",

You, a brave warrior, challenge yourself to enter the arena…  When you first started the map, it is recommended for you to collect your Daily Loot to obtain a headstart. Daily Loot is a loot that you get daily (Minecraft time). Make sure you talk to every single villager that there is to understand the map completely.\nTo fight monsters, go into the entrance in the right, to watch a battle, go to the entrance in the middle. Follow the path of each entry as you go. In the fight entrance, you will see a red line when you want to open the gate, pass the red line to open the gate automatically and a battle will start.

Some of them are essential to build at some point in time since they will allow you to more easily keep track of the different items you’ve collected throughout your life span in Minecraft. Redstone is pretty much the key to reach maximum efficiency and to be able to much quicker reach the End (in a positive way).  Wardrobe: Mix up your choice of colors for the day! Use the arrows to select among a wide range of dyed armors, step into the wardrobe and then press the button to automatically get dressed. Imagine if this existed in real life.. it would really make life so much easier!  Industrial Elevator: This is a fully automated elevator and it appears to be completely bug free. You can even call the elevator in case the door is closed simply by pressing a button.  Massive Auto Storage: Have you ever got to a point where you’ve collected more items than you ever think you’d need? Well, then it’s time to build an automatic storage machine.  Drop the items into the input chest and then have them automatically sorted in different containers. You can later get whatever items you want by pulling the levers to select them and then take them from the output chest.",

This world is a 100% automatic Death Run. Interested? Let’s find out more!  Objectives There will be 1 death and 1-9 runners.  If you are Death: You are trying to kill all runners with traps, and power-ups (such as kill a runner, give runners bad effects, etc., which costs emeralds), or hold them down until the game is over.  We will tell you how to get emeralds below.  If you are a Runner: You are trying to get to the end of the map without using all of your lives (you get 3 lives in the beginning, you can buy lives at each checkpoint in “life stations”, which costs emeralds), and before the time runs out. There are multiple obstacles that death controls, so be careful of the death!  How to Get Emeralds You will get emeralds in the following ways:  1. By participating, you will get randomly 1-4 emeralds each game.  2. By winning, either as Death or as a Runner, you will get randomly 4-16 emeralds each game.  There is a spectator mode, if someone joins mid-game, or if someone gets eliminated, they can press the spectator mode button when the game is running!  Now you can play without any struggles, remember, never give up, even though some of the obstacles are HARD!",

Around the island there is an ocean and after the ocean you will find a normal generated  Minecraft World, so that you can play this map in survival mode too.  In the world you will spawn at a pirate ship, which is heading for the island. With a little boat you can drive to the island. You will find a big lonly jugle island (circa 1600 x 1600 blocks) with a river and two mountains called Pirate-Island. At and around the island there are some special places: the big pirate ship, a little island near the big island, a coral reef with a big shell, a reef with many ship wrecks, some hot water sources under water, a big Turtle-Beach, a little fort for the defense and a secret Pirate-Cave with a big treasure.  At the spawn you will find some more specific information about the location from the things I mentioned. I used some command blocks in the Pirate-Cave for some particles… so you should turn the gamerule “commandblockoutput” into false.  Because of WorldPainter, with which I created this island, there aren`t things from the aquatic update under water… I tried to make this a bit more interesting with the hand built reef, the coral reef and the hot water sources.",
