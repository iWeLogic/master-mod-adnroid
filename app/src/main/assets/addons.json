They are essentially a mobile chest which you can wear on your back while traveling around in your world. It&rsquo;s great if you are out on an adventure and need somewhere to offload your blocks and items. It&rsquo;s easy to wear and also easy to take off in case you need to access the storage space easily. It&rsquo;s definitely a must have for all the survivors out there!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">How does it work?</span></p>\n<p>The backpack has a very low spawn rate. If you find one then you can make it your own by using an Emerald on the backpack. Windows 10: Hold an Emerald in your hand and right-click the backpack to claim it. Before you can use it you will need to use a dye to dye the backpack. Once dyed, you will then be able to open the backpack and store things in it. Walk and stand near the backpack and it will automatically jump on your back.</p>\n<p>You can only open your bag by placing it down on the ground and opening it like the inventory of a llama. To get it off your back, sneak! It&rsquo;s also possible to open other players bags while they are wearing them, but it will only work if the backpack is unlocked. If you hold a tripwire hook in your hand and click tame then the backpack will lock and other players will no longer be able to open your backpack.</p>",

    "description": "By ashminggu<p>When on the topic of British sports cars, car manufacturers that’d come to most people’s mind would probably be Aston Martin, McLaren, Jaguar, Lotus (if you still consider it British) and maybe Bentley if you consider their cars sporty. While these are car manufacturers that do make amazing and high quality sports cars, lets take a step back into time to appreciate the lesser known manufacturers.Triumph - a British motor company that existed throughout the late 19th century till the late 20th century - a manufacturer which created one of the most beautiful vintage sports cars to ever exist (in my opinion). And in this case, the Spitfire MK.4 - a car which may not be the most reliable and fastest car on the road even when compared to other cars of it's time, but it is without a doubt definitely a beautiful, sleek and elegantly designed car which just has that sophisticated vintage design. And even if you are bothered by it's performance, hey, you can always tune and modify it like there's no tomorrow.  Play your cards right and you will not only possess an elegant vintage sports car, but one that is actually up to par with modern standards. Vintage design, equipped with modern technology and performance - truly a spectacular combination.",

The Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution III / Lancer Evolution 3 is the perfect car if you want that sweet 4WD, 4 doors, big wang and big power and is obviously very practical. This car can be really fast when tuned as seen in Initial D second stage where Kyoichi Sudo of the Emperors beat Takumi's AE86 so hard the engine blew. The Evo III made its debut in the WRC in 1995 - the year where the iconic Subaru Impreza and Toyota Celica GT-FOUR were battling it out. Although the Evo III didn't win that season it was still a very fast car driven by rally legends such as Tommi Mäkinen. '95 was a confusing season so can't really blame them (cough cough Toyota cheating) The Evo III is also known in the movie scene as it was featured in Initial D and Jackie Chan's '95 action-sports film; Thunderbolt. The Evo III has a good reputation and it's a pretty underrated car compared to the newer Evos so you know it's good.Introduction written by: the DORIFTO lover (TDL), links to his socials below.",

You can then use it as a mount and control it by the use of a stick.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #800000;\">Titanis</span> (replaces chickens) are hostile birds which look like a big prehistoric bird or something similar to an ostrich. They are hostile and since they replace chickens their spawn rate is quite frequent.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #008080;\">Giant Wolves</span> (replace wolves) are slightly larger than a normal wolf. As an adult they are hostile and this means that you must find a baby wolf in order to tame one.</p> <p>There are two types of <span style=\"color: #008000;\">Scorpions</span>. The black one (replaces the cave spider) is hostile and has a venomous stinger tail which is extremely poisonous. The other one is green and neutral (replaces the normal spider). You can tame the green one with any type of raw meat.<br />Sit on the back of your tamed scorpion and control it with a stick.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">The Medusa</span> (replaces endermen) is another mythological creature which has venomous snakes in place of hair. Whatever you do &ndash; don&rsquo;t look into her eyes! She is much more dangerous than an enderman!</p> <p><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Little Dragons</span> (replace bats) are extremely hostile and will spit fireballs at anything which moves.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">The Ents</span> (replace creepers) are guardians of the nature. They will attack anything which doesn&rsquo;t belong there. For example, zombies, skeletons and any of the above creatures will be attacked. Your tamed animals will do nothing to protect you against this magnificent creature &ndash; it&rsquo;s simply too frightening to them.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">A Unicorn</span> (replaces horses) is a legendary animal with a horn on its forehead. Besides the new look it still behaves much the same to a horse.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Zeus</span> (replaces wither skeleton) is the god of sky and thunder. Naturally, he will be friendly and don&rsquo;t do you any harm. But if you decide to try him in a battle then he will show you no mercy and try to kill you at any cost. He has 100 hearts and is considered a boss.<br />Watch out! Lightning can strike at any time if you mess with Zeus!</p> <p><span style=\"color: #800000;\">The Minotaur</span> (replaces stray) is a bull-headed monster with the body of a man often depicted in Greek Mythology. It wields an enormous axe which can cause as much as 22 attack damage and it is also resistant to knockbacks.</p>",

The nature of the S13’s perfectly balanced body/chassis made it easy to control and in this case allowed it’s driver to perform drifts with ease; on top of the fact that it made drivers felt more engaged to the road whilst driving. It was cheap too, making it all the more a popular choice of a vehicle especially among the youngsters of the time - affordable, fun to drive and had a flamboyant design. And even if drifting isn’t your cup of tea, there’s no reason not to enjoy it. As mentioned earlier its essentially a specialty coupe, meaning you could possibly daily drive it - making you without a doubt a million times cooler than 85% of the other drivers (their cars atleast) everytime you go out. Like tuning and fancy bodykits? The S13 has that covered as well. Due to how tough the CA18DET engines (for the 1988-1990 specs) and the SR20DET engines (1991+) were, they were able to withstand up to 300hp when tuned. As for bodykits, well, a Rocket Bunny kit exists, perfect for anyone who loves wide cars. With all that said, the S13 is essentially a perfect choice for almost all your personal needs whether it’d be for your own enjoyment or simply for a daily ride.",

For example, you can tame them, have them fight for you or you can send them away on missions such as hunting or to go fishing.</p> <p><br /><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Minions</span><br />Minions can be found spawning in the Nether (because they replace zombie pigmen). You can also spawn them using the zombie pigman spawn egg.</p> <p>To tame a minion you will first need to find a big one. Then feed it some bananas (carrots) until it likes you. Tame chance: 33%. If you find a baby minion you can feed it some bananas too to accelerate its growing process.<br />Long press on the minion with a banana (carrot) and press <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Tame</span></p> <p>A <span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">tamed</span> minion will by default follow its master.

Features unique mossy stone patches and more plant life to give it a more jungle feel. Beware, dangerous monsters spawn here.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Underground Tundra:</span><br />Generates under tundra and ice spike biomes. Features special ice stone and large patches of packed ice and rare blue ice farther down.</p> <p><br /><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Undead Miner:</span><br />The undead remains of unlucky villager miners. They are a dangerous foe on account of their pickaxes. Drops bones and rarely ingots. Found underground below Y=40 or in abandoned mineshafts.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Brood Spider:</span><br />Large spiders that carry their brood on their abdomen, waiting to sick hordes of spiderlings your way. They are rare but pose a significant threat to early players when encountered, similar to endermen. Keep your distance when possible. Drops string, spider eyes, and a spider heart used to craft the boss spawn. Found underground everywhere and in higher levels in the jungle.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Spider Eggs:</span><br />Spider eggs don&rsquo;t pose a direct threat themselves and in fact, can offer loot when destroyed. However, they also release several spiderlings when broken in addition to their treasure. Spider eggs are found in Spider Nests that generate periodically underground. Treasure consists of cave themed items.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Spiderling:</span><br />Small baby spiders spawned by Brood Spiders, Spider Eggs, and the Spider Matriarch. While they pose little threat by themselves, they are dangerous in numbers.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Bristle Spider:</span><br />A ranged spider that accompanies the Spider Matriarch during the boss battle. It fires a slew of bristles at the player.</p> <p><br />New Passive Mobs:</p> <p><br /><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Ore Crawler:</span><br />These little arthropods are found everywhere underground and drop their respective ore when killed. They run from the player, so you have to be quick! So far only coal has been implemented, but others will be added in the next update.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Villager Miners:</span><br />These poor villagers have become trapped and need your help to rescue them! They are found trapped in webs underground and you free them by punching the webs off. They are weak and require food to get the strength to follow you. Once you feed them, they will need to be lead back to the nearest village where they will reward you with XP and become a Miner themed Villager. They use any work stand that other villagers use and trade miner themed items.</p> <p><span style=\"color: #800080;\">New Boss Mob:</span><br /><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Spider Matriarch:</span><br />This Spider Matriarch is the largest of the bunch and is not in the best mood when summoned. To summon the Spider Matriarch, one must craft the Spider Matriarch summon using 4 Spider Hearts and 5 string. Use it on any spider to turn it into an egg that will grow until bursting, summoning the boss. The Spider Matriarch has 275 HP and switches between two attack modes depending on how far she is from her target. In ranged mode, she summons reinforcements in the form of spiderlings, brood spiders, and bristle spiders. She will periodically fire bristles at the player in this mode as well. When in Melee mode, she will summon only spiderlings but will also charge the player. A shield, a bow, and at least iron armor and sword are strongly recommended for this fight. The Spider Matriarch drops large amounts of cave related items including a boss trophy to display in your house.</p>",

On it’s debut, it came in 2 standard options; a 4-door saloon/sedan option and a lesser well known 5-door hatchback, which on itself isn’t bad, as visually, it looks good and it is in many people’s opinion, the greatest and most original Proton car up to this day. But what if it never was intended to be a saloon? Or better yet, what if the Saga came in more options? In this addon, I’ve made a few concepts of the Saga MK.1 based off different car classes which include coupe, hatchback, wagon and limousine classes, classes which the Saga MK.1 never had. Just a simple addon that showcases one of the main and most interesting possibilities of what the Saga could have been. A more sport oriented vehicle? A modified coupe or 3-door hatchback. A more stylish family vehicle? How about an estate wagon? Or how about a domestic vehicle meant for diplomatic or executive affairs? One word; limousine. All these possibilities, now available in Minecraft.",

The Dinobots is a subfaction of the Autobots (meaning, the friendly ones) and that means that they fight on the same side as the Autobots (e.g. Optimus Prime and so on).<br />Blackout is an extremely dangerous Transformer which will hunt down his enemies and kill them with no mercy. He&rsquo;s very fast and spawns mostly everywhere since he replaces the creeper.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Shockwave</span> is an evil Decepticon which is under the command of &ldquo;Megatron&rdquo;.

Mahi mahi Also known as a dolphin fish, it adds diversity to the ocean and drops the same loot as normal fish. Lion fish This a new type of fish which can attack the player with poison if they get too close.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Boss mobs</span>: Wraithen boss This is a formidable enemy against the wither because it&rsquo;s very hard to beat.

Chill rave boss It can appear very rarely in the frozen ocean biome, it uses spikes to protect itself and can switch to ranged mode from time to time. It throws ice blocks to slow you down and it can kill an unprepared player in 2 hits.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #800080;\">Hostile mobs</span>: Stone eater Inspired from the anime series &ldquo;Goblin Slayer&rdquo;, These will give you mining fatigue and can spawn underground.

Ender carcass This variant of the zombie can teleport like an enderman, throws snowballs, and spawns in the end. Frost eater This variant of the zombie spawns in frozen oceans. Similar to the Stray, it can give you slowness but it lasts for 45 seconds. Ryft This hostile entity can disappear in a matter of seconds, as it gives you blindness, they can spawn in dark places around the forest. Their eyes glow purple in the dark. Skeleton knight This is them melee mode of the skeleton, it holds a shield and an iron sword and it has more health. Sunken An underwater variant of the skeleton, a friend for the Drowned.</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">New villagers</span>: Warrior villager Protects the village against monsters, the complete opposite of the Vindicator. Turreteer This villager uses a fully loaded turret, they behave they same way as turrets but shoots far more arrows than they do, you can&rsquo;t upgrade them either.

Right click to perform a horizontal attack and Shift + Right click to perform a vertical attack. mobile phones users must hold the screen to make this.<p>The Grottol are crystal crustaceans that live in the underground, also called \"Living Ores\" they are considered as a pressed resource of diamonds, only the fastest will be able to catch them before they escape, they are very fast and have the ability to climb like a spider, considerate that only iron pickaxes or higher are capable of penetrating their diamond shell.<p>The Foliaath are plant monsters that the only thing they want is to eat without stopping, they are generated in the jungles like ordinary ferns but they will emere if their prey gets close enough, attacking them melee is a difficult task so a new way must be found to attack them from a distance.\nWhen they die, they will drop foliaath seeds that are used to plant a new foliaath, just let the baby grow and feed it with meat every half day for two days until it grows but be careful! Even if you have raised it, it does not mean that they are tame and will attack you anyway.<p>These winged serpents called Naga make the hills dangerous, possess great flying abilities and an acid poison which is deadly for a person, hitting them with a projectile at the moment when the Naga is preparing an attack will bring down the Naga giving the opportunity to attack to his opponent. When he dies he will leave his fang which can be used to create a poisonous dagger or an antidote to poisons.<p>Barako is the chief of the Barakoa tribe, sitting fixed on a throne in the Barakoa village, he attacks the intruders by extracting the power of the sun to release it in the form of solar rays, he can also summon Barakoas allies with their masks to defend him from his opponent. When he dies he will give his mask as a reward: the Sol Visage which will grant its wearer the ability to summon Barakoas allies through his masks, unfortunately it will not grant his heliomancy, this power dies with Barako, maybe there is some other way.",

Other than opening doors this mob will sleep occasionally</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff00ff;\">Arch-Illager</span><br />We see this little bad of cuteness at the end of the trailer, Nothing is know about his behaviours so in this addons he summons Pillagers</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">Necromancer</span><br />We get a brief look at him in the Trailer, It&rsquo;s called a Necromancer according to Eckosoldier who got his hands on the game at E3<br />In this addon, The Necromancer summons a lot of Skeleton Vanguards!</p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">Skeleton Vanguard</span><br />This is believed to be the Army of The Necromancer, They have shields and spears and they&rsquo;ll not hesitate to use them against you.

That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s called The Blue Thing because I have no idea what else to call it. He summons ghosts constantly.<br />Ghosts are floating entities with no collusion with blocks and actual translucent textures, You&rsquo;ll be able to see through these mobs. They also have a cute (but deadly) attacking animation</p>",
